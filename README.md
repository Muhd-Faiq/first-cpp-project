About:
Usually in any hospital. The process of assigning recording and assigning a ward to a patient is a lot work. Doctors and nurses had to record their patient’s information on paper and what happen if the paper is damage or lost. The visitor of the family member also had a hard time locating where the patient if located in the big hospital is. So the purpose of our project is to design a program that will store the patient information, assign a ward for the patient and a function for the visitor to check which ward and room the patient is placed.

Objective:
-To ease the process of recording patient’s information and avoid information lost.
-To ease the visitor to find the patient’s room
